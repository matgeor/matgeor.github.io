Covid 19 pandemic posed various challenges, in teaching, learning and evaluation, particularly due to the social distancing restrictions. Virtual lab solutions appear to offer a potential solution, but have few inherent difficulties, which make them less ideal to be used in a classroom setting. Such difficulties  can be overcome by making use of GeoGebra applets, to do virtual experiments. GeoGebra applets are usable with a basic mobile phone browser, light, easily accessible and free.  Several GeoGebra applets were developed to perform UG lab experiments. Such applets have the potential to provide rich learning experience to the students.

The applets are <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/geogebra-experiments/electricity-experiments?authuser=0" target="_blank">listed here</a>.

This activity was selected for the 'award in teacher category' of <a href="https://www.indapt.org/docs/noticeboard/results-ncicp-2022.pdf#page=2" target="_blank">National Competition In Computational Physics 2022</a>, conducted by the <a href="https://www.indapt.org/" target="_blank">Indian Association Of Physics Teachers</a> .
